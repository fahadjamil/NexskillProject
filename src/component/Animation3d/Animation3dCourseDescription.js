          Students will use Computer modeling to explore the principles of
          3-dimensional design. Projects involving objects, character, game
          environment and architectural modeling will emphasize the aesthetic
          concepts of spatial proportion (scale, angle and position) Silhouette,
          negative space, balance lighting/shadow and textures. Student will
          emerge with the ability to create well designed 3D models and be
          familiar with the basics of polygonal modeling, texturing lighting and
          rendering for computer games.
