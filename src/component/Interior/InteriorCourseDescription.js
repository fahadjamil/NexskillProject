          Interior design is a multi-faceted profession in which creative and
          technical solutions are applied within a structure to achieve a built
          interior environment. These solutions are functional, enhance the
          quality of life and culture of the occupants, and are aesthetically
          attractive. The interior design process follows a systematic and
          coordinated methodology, including research, analysis and integration
          of knowledge into the creative process, whereby the needs and
          resources of the client are satisfied to produce an interior space
          that fulfills the project goals.
