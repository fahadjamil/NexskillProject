          Graphic design is all around us, in a myriad of forms, both on screen
          and in print, yet it is always made up of images and words to create a
          communication goal. Our course sequence exposes students to the
          fundamental skills required to make sophisticated graphic design:
          process, historical context, and communication through image-making
          and typography. The sequence is completed by a final project that
          applies the skills of each course and peer feedback in a finished
          branding project suitable for a professional portfolio.<br/> The goal of
          this specialization is to equip learners with a set of transferable
          formal and conceptual tools for “making and communicating” in the
          field of graphic design. This core skill set will equip learners for
          formal studies in graphic design, and a starting point for further
          work in graphic design, editorial design and much more.
