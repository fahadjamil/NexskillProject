          This is a beginning character design course with an emphasis on
          creating memorable characters with interesting personalities & shapes
          to tell a story. The goal is to visually communicate our characters
          from life observations, reference, and our imaginations. As we
          continue the course, the students will get used to the idea of
          iteration and refinement in designs, better serving the story and
          direction. Exploration, getting out of your comfort zone, and visually
          communicating through drawing will be major components to our class.
